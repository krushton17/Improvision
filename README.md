# Improvision

Improvision is a web app designed to help learn and practice chord-tone guitar improvisation. It has been designed primarily with jazz improvisation in mind.

## Features

* Animated diagram showing chord and scale tone changes in real-time
* Color-coding to highlight the root note, guide tones, and auxiliary tones
* Text-based or drag-and-drop song editing
* Ability to save and upload songs as text files
* Simple MIDI accompaniment

### Planned Features

* Single chord mode
* Chord-scale associations
* Transposition
* Cadence analysis mode: color-coded analysis of chord progressions used in the song
* Library of transcribed songs
* More sophisticated MIDI playback
* Support for additional string instruments, and possibly eventually keyboards as well
* Various aesthetic improvements

## Getting Started

Improvision is currently hosted [online](https://improvision.app).

Feel free to download and/or fork the project on GitHub if you like. (Note: I am not a professional programmer and this is my first major project on GitHub, so my code and git flow are very much works in progress.)

### Prerequisites

As of August 2018, Improvision has only been tested in Google Chrome. If you experience any errors or strange formatting, try viewing the site in Chrome.
